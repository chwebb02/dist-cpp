# Dist
Dist is a programming language for distributed computing environments.


## Motivation
Modern computing is distributed in nature.  Modern languages were not designed with this paradigm in mind, and thus are not capable of fully utilizing resources and providing ample abstraction to allow programmers to easily do so either.  Dist is designed with heterogenous, distributed systems in mind.
